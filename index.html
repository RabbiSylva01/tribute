          <h2 id="tribute-info">Biography of Pastor</h2>
          <p class="start">Marcello Jeremie Tunasi was born on January 27, the eldest in a family of seven children,
               three boys and four girls, two of whom are also pastors. His light skin, as he likes to say,
                is the result of the mixture of his great grandparents from Germany. 
                Originally from the village of Kabar√© in Kivu, a province of the Democratic Republic of Congo,
                 Marcello was raised by his parents, including a father who was a former teacher and now a prefect of Kivu,
                  where he attended elementary school before moving to Kinshasa
          </p>
          <p class="start"> 
            He was converted in 1990 following an apparition of Jesus Christ.
             In 1996, he received his call to the ministry. In 1998, 
             he became the main pastor of the church La Compassion located in Kinshasa,
              in the Democratic Republic of Congo. In 2009,
            he founded the CREFM community (Center for Revival,
             Evangelism, Training and Mission) based on the values of Love, Holiness, Power and Balance in Jesus Christ.
            Passionate about Christ, 
            he travels the world preaching his word and making disciples.
             Healing the sick, freeing the captives as Christ commanded in Matthew 10:8 and 28:19.
